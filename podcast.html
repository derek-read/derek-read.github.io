			The Coach's Road Podcast is something I started with my classmate and friend 
			Rick Schreiber. Through our podcast we wanted to explore the topic we were 
			learning about in school more deeply. This has been a very great experience 
			so far and has allowed me to connect with experts from all over the world and 
			in different fields of sports. I have learned a lot so far about coaching, 
			leading, teaching, and supporting. Our show's motto and a theme we constantly 
			return to is Humans, Athletes then Players and this is something we try to 
			live by as coaches of young athletes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The motivation behind our podcast is two fold. First we wanted to deepen our
			 own understanding of the topics we learn about in school while getting 
			 practical ideas from experts that we can then put into our own practice. The 
			 other piece of our motivation is to provide interesting and insightful 
			 conversations for coaches all over the world in all sports. We all have 
			 something to learn from each other and that is something this show has 
			 provided for me, a chance to learn. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Moving forward with the show we hope to continue to grow and bring in new and 
			exciting guests. We want to continuously improve and grow as people, hosts and 
			coaches. Our learning is just getting started and we are not stopping anytime 
			soon!

				<em>“I firmly believe I don’t have to balance it [individual improvement and winning], in any means… Of course you play the game in order to win it, but you win or loss… in a way it does not matter for the next day. If we win we still practice the same way, if we loss we still practice the same way because we focus on only getting better.”</em>
